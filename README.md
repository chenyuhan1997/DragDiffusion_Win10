# DragDiffusion_Win10
DeagDiffusion's Win10 deployment version. Very simple. We didn't upload a pre-trained model. You need to download StableDiffusion's pre-training model (44G) by yourself. Also you need to download the "bash" to make it work on windows. Finally, don't change my settings, or it may crash.
